#Recitation 1

###Why do we use IDEs?
* Syntax highlighting
* Organization for large projects (file browser)
* Nice buttons for projects, classes, etc.
* Refactoring (rename everything at once, even across several files)
* Autocompletion
* Auto-imports
* Inline documentation
* Built-in console
* Built-in compiler
* (Real-time) error checking -- errors in the actual code you wrote
* DEBUGGER -- runtime errors (especially exceptions and logic mistakes)
* Many more things for more advanced software engineering

###Example
* Download the SandwichMaker example at https://github.com/chunweiliu/comp401r1/tree/master/src/example
* Create your first project with the example
* Play around with it

###Practice
* Download the ClockCalculator skeleton at https://github.com/chunweiliu/comp401r1/tree/master/src/practice
* Finish the project with the help of debuger
